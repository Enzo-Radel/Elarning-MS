# Frontend placeholder

This folder is reserved for a future Angular frontend for `ms-progresso`.

Suggested structure when implemented:
- `frontend/` — Angular project root
  - `src/app` — components and services
  - `README.md` — instructions to run `npm install` and `ng serve`

For now this file is a placeholder so the project keeps a clear separation between backend and frontend.
